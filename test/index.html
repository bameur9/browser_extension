                The Columbine High School massacre, commonly referred to as Columbine, was a school shooting and attempted bombing that occurred on April 20, 1999, 
                at Columbine High School in Columbine, Colorado, United States. The perpetrators, twelfth-grade students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, 
                murdered twelve students and one teacher. Ten students were killed in the school library, where Harris and Klebold subsequently committed suicide. 
                Twenty-one additional people were injured by gunshots, and gunfire was also exchanged with the police. Another three people were injured trying to escape. 
                At the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting at a high school in U.S. history, until it was surpassed by the Parkland high school shooting in February 2018. 
                It is also the deadliest mass shooting in the state of Colorado.

                You might be surprised to learn that microhylids in Peru, India, Sri Lanka and perhaps elsewhere have developed close relationships with large spiders. 
                One of the first published discussions of this phenomenon was produced by Crocraft & Hambler (1989). 
                Noting a close association between individuals of the Dotted humming frog Chiasmocleis ventrimaculata and the burrowing 
                theraphosid tarantula Xenesthis immanis in southeastern Peru (but read on), they suggested that the spider 
                – well capable of killing and eating a frog of this size – used chemical cues to recognise the frogs. Young spiders have sometimes been observed to grab the frogs, 
                examine them with their mouthparts, and then release them unharmed. Microhylids are probably unpalatable due to their skin toxins, and this might explain how this 
                association arose in the first place.

                In popular practice, recreational drug use is generally tolerated as a social behaviour, rather than perceived as the medical condition of self-medication. 
                However, drug use and drug addiction are severely stigmatized everywhere in the world. Many people also use prescribed and controlled depressants such as opioids, 
                opiates and benzodiazepines. What controlled substances are considered generally unlawful to possess varies by country, but usually includes cannabis, cocaine, 
                opioids, MDMA, amphetamine, methamphetamine, psychedelics, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. As of 2015, it is estimated that about 5% of people worldwide aged 15 to 65 
                (158 million to 351 million) had used controlled drugs at least once.
